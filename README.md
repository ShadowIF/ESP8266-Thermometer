This project was created in educational purposes. Plain kitchen thermometer with NodeMCU 0.9 board.
I used websocet protocol to communicate with React-based site. 
Provided code for NodeMCU requires INA219 current sensor along with NTC thermistor. 
I didn't care about debris left by built-in creator (like react logo).
